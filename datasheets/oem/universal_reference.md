# Universal OEM Baseboard Reference

![](../../.gitbook/assets/universal_reference%20%281%29.png)

The universal OEM reference board is a reference design suitable for the W01, L01, L04 and G01 OEM modules, making it possible to have a single PCB design that can accommodate all of our OEM modules.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you require a reference board for the G01, this design is the only one that is suitable. The L01 reference board does not contain the necessary SIM slot.
