### Take into consideration

* If you are using iOS 12, turn off your Wi-Fi completely on your iPhone.
* Only use a Wi-Fi network with 2.4GHz as Pycom devices cannot connect to a 5GHz network.
* Your device might be provisioned faster if you move your device closer to your Wi-Fi router.
* Make sure your devices are powered on and running firmware 1.20.1 or newer.
* You cannot provision the same devices on the different Pybytes account unless you [erased them completely](../../advance/cli/#erase-all) and flashed the latest firmware again with FW updater tool.
* If there is a spinning wheel on your screen, that means that your device is being provisioned. If it has disappeared, then press the START button again.
* Please take into account that we are developing a new feature and therefore some niggles can occur. (Please bear with us!) If any issues occur whilst you are using Pybytes iOS, then drop us a line at <a href="mailto:support@pycom.io">support@pycom.io</a>.

### FAQ

<span style="background-color:#00cc96;">&nbsp;I canâ€™t connect to Wi-Fi in Pybytes iOS&nbsp;</span>

* Firstly, check your version of iOS. If it is iOS 12, then turn off the Wi-Fi connection on your phone. Following this, try to use Pybytes iOS again, and it should now automatically connect to the WiFi.

* If you have version that is later than iOS 12, check your Wi-Fi router setting. It should run on a 2.4 HGz Wi-Fi network.

<span style="background-color:#00cc96;">&nbsp;No devices were provisioned after 5 min.&nbsp;</span>

* Check if your devices are on

* Move your devices closer to the Wi-Fi router

* Check that no-one else in the room is trying to provision devices with the Pybytes iOS app.

<span style="background-color:#00cc96;">&nbsp;How long does the provisioning take?&nbsp;</span>

* On average, it takes up to 2 minutes to provision 6 devices.

Our hope is that Pybytes iOS will simplify the device provisioning process. However, as we are still in a development pipeline, sometimes there can be a hitch in the silk. If that happens, please let us know! Drop us a line at <a href="mailto:support@pycom.io">support@pycom.io</a>.
