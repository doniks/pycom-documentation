## Integration with external services

Pybytes offers a way to interact with external IoT platform or custom services, including the following:

* [AWS IoT](amazon-iot.md): a managed cloud platform that lets connected devices easily and securely interact with Cloud applications and other devices
* [Microsoft Azure](azure.md): a comprehensive collection of services and solutions designed to help you create end-to-end IoT applications on Azure
* [Google Cloud IoT](google.md): a complete set of tools to connect, process, store, and analyse data, both at the edge and in the cloud
* [Web Hooks](webhooks.md): this allows for user-defined HTTP callbacks to a defined remote destination. All elements of the requests (headers, query string parameters, etc) are customisable
